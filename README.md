## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

This is a list of technologies I've used professionally, roughly ranked by my fluency in them. This is not an exhaustive list, and I also love to dive into learning new things.

`Python` `Clojure` `Go` `Javascript` `AWS` `GCP` `SQL` `React` `Elasticsearch` `Airflow` `DBT`

## <a name="seeking">What I'm looking for</a>

A product-led company with high collaboration both in & between departments / teams, a strong vision, and strong opinions that avoid verging on dogma.

I'd like to avoid siloed teams, and white-labeled products.

I would strongly prefer a hybrid on-site/remote model in London -- ideally coming to the office between 2 and 3 days a week. I have Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK (yay!), so I do not require a sponsor.

## <a name="synopsis">Me in a nutshell (spoilers ahead)</a>

Ultimately, I am a product-focused software engineer. I have never been obsessed with software for software's sake -- rather, I love software as a means to solve real, tangible problems. I learned this about myself when I worked for Intercom, where I was the first ever US-based hire. My role was "administrative" in title only -- in reality, my job was to free the founding team from having to think about anything that wasn't our product. From 6 to 350+ employees, I managed multiple operational departments, some of them single-handedly. Writing scripts to help me do my job effectively became essential to my productivity.

In 2016, I made the choice to study software development in a serious way. I applied for one of the world's most selective coding bootcamps: Makers Academy in London. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my studies - and I fell in love with London in the process.

My engineering travels have spanned several industries and technologies since. I've worked across the stack, from productionising machine-learning models alongside AI engineers, to maintaining complex backend systems and pipelines, to creating UIs and managing bots.

## <a name="projects">Projects I'm proud of</a>

- **Quite a few drafts of Markov model Twitter bots, none of which made it to production**
  - Inspired by [@erowidrecruiter](https://twitter.com/erowidrecruiter)
  - The most "successful" of these has been the result of combining Tyler the Creator lyrics with beef wellington recipes.
- **[No Parks After Dark](https://github.com/macebake/noParksAfterDarkBackend)**
  - A safer routing app which provides walking & public transit directions that avoid parks, tunnels, alleyways, et cetera after dark.
  - My contribution to this project was primarily to build an API using Node.js, which would return routing instructions.
- **[Emojify RSpec Formatter Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/emojify_rspec_formatter)**
  - A pet project of mine, this gem reformats RSpec output into happy or sad emojis, based on whether the test has passed or failed.
  - [@iamdevloper](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper) said it best: [_“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to include emojis in test runner output. That sucks.”_](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/839858241450344448?s=20)

## <a name="bonuscontent">Bonus Content</a>

- :airplane: I'm that person at the beer garden always checking FlightRadar24. I know my 737s from my A320s. I even contribute data to FR24 with my home ADS-B receiver. You will find conflicting opinions amongst my friends about whether or not this is endearing.
- :muscle: Fitness in general, but specifically Olympic Weightlifting is my favourite hobby. Please don't get me started about the gym, though. I'm annoying myself even imagining that conversation.
- :books: I love to read. Mostly fiction, a recent favourite being Piranesi by Susanna Clarke, but sometimes non-fiction, if it's playful or poetic enough. For example, Black Hole Survival Guide by Janna Levin.
